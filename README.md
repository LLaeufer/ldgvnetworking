# ldgv - Label dependent session types

This repository contains an implementation of a frontend (parser and
type checker) and a backend for LDGV.

The syntax is described in `syntax.txt`. The directory `examples/`
contains some examples, source files end in `.ldgv`.

## Interpreter

There are two ways to run the interpreter, via the [command
line](#command-line) and via a local [web page](#web-page).


## C backend

The C backend is not yet feature complete:

* [x] syntax elements
  * [x] variable bindings
  * [x] integer literals & math operations
  * [x] label literals & case expressions
  * [x] lamdas
  * [x] call expressions, partial application
  * [x] pairs construction & destructuring
  * [x] recursion
    * [x] recursive bindings
    * [x] `natrec`
  * [x] `fork`
  * [x] channel operations
    * [x] `new`
    * [x] `recv`
    * [x] `send`
* [x] entrypoint generation
    * [x] `main(void)`
    * [x] user requested (via `ldst__run`)
* [ ] garbage collector
* [ ] tests

It is available only via the [command line](#command-line). See there for
building and running.


## Building

### Command Line

To build the command line program the Haskell build tool `cabal` is required with GHC â‰¥8.6.1.

```
cabal run :exe:ldgv-exe -- --help
```

builds and runs the executable.

### Web Page

To build the webpage the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/) is
required, preferably with a binary cache set up as described
[here](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk/blob/master/README.md).

```
nix-build -A ghcjs.ldgv
```

builds the project. Afterwards there is a `index.html` in `results/bin/ldgv.exe`.

Incremental builds are not supported by `nix-build`, instead building via
`nix-shell` and `cabal` is possible:

1. Enter the `nix-shell`, this provides you with `cabal` and `ghcjs`:

      ```
      nix-shell -A shells.ghcjs
      ```

2. Use `cabal` inside the new shell, with a custom `--project-file`:

      ```
      cabal --project-file=cabal-ghcjs.project v2-build
      ```


## Testing

```
cabal test
```
